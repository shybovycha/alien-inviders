## Foreword

This was my first game i ever created using my programming skills.
This is a space simulator. There is still no idea or story for the 
game yet as the first version was created when i was just a kid.
So, do not be very strict while observing these games, please.

## Developer notes

Each version of the game is contained in its own branch.
Some versions (written in [*DarkBasic*](https://github.com/TheGameCreators/Dark-Basic-Pro)) are not syncronizing with the 
FPS so they look horrible. Others (written in [*BlitzBasic*](https://github.com/blitz-research/blitz3d)) do
have the syncing so they look a bit more pretty.

Now i am thinking on the new version of that old stuff. So, you
may be faced a new branch soon - it may be a great challenge for the ones
in the repository right now. Who knows, maybe it shall become a **1.0** version
of the game one day...
