## AlienInviders

## Foreword

This was my first game I ever created using my programming skills.
This is a space simulator. There is still no idea or story for the
game yet as the first version was created when I was just a kid.
So, do not be very strict while observing these games, please.

## Notes

Each version of the game is contained in its own branch:

* [`old-2`](https://github.com/shybovycha/alien-inviders/tree/old-2) and [`old-3`](https://github.com/shybovycha/alien-inviders/tree/old-3) are made in [*DarkBasic*](https://github.com/TheGameCreators/Dark-Basic-Pro) and lack frame & CPU clock syncronization, so they look horrible; the [demo is available on YouTube](https://youtu.be/3WihQBqXRGE)
* [`old-4`](https://github.com/shybovycha/alien-inviders/tree/old-4) is made in [*BlitzBasic*](https://github.com/blitz-research/blitz3d), it has the syncing; watch the [demo on YouTube](https://youtu.be/ihvSbonJZfY)
* [`rework-2022`](https://github.com/shybovycha/alien-inviders/tree/rework-2022) is currently a work-in-progress version and is made in Rust with [WGPU](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/)
