h1. alien-inviders 0.3

h2. Brief overview

This was the third version of my game. This one contains 
the same functionality as the previous one, but replaces
the AI logic, spheres with the spaceship models, adds some
menus and sounds.

h2. Controls

**space** - shoot
**Ctrl** - speed up
**Shift** - slow down
**Enter** - interaction: pick up the item; enter the planet menu, etc.
**Q** - quests window
**Tab** - your current stats

h2. Notes

For some reason, no *exit* action was preserved. So, you need to minimize the 
game and close it using Windows.
